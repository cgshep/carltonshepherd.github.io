	<p>I am a Lecturer (~Assistant Professor) in Computer Science at Newcastle University, United Kingdom, based within the School of Computing. Prior to this, I was a Senior Research Scientist at the Information Security Group (ISG) at Royal Holloway, University of London</a>. 
	<p>I was previously at Atom Bank, the UK's first mobile bank; and at OneSpan, a NASDAQ-listed financial technology vendor, based at their Innovation Centre in Cambridge, working on the design and implementation of privacy-enhancing technologies.
	<p>My expertise centres broadly around mobile security, trusted execution environments, sensor data analysis, and side-channel analysis.</p>
	<p>If you are interested in pursuing a project, Ph.D. etc. on the above topics, then please reach out at <a href="mailto:carlton.shepherd@ncl.ac.uk">carlton.shepherd@ncl.ac.uk</a>.</p>
	<p>I hold a Ph.D. from Royal Holloway, University of London, and a B.Sc. in Computer Science from Newcastle University.</p>

	<h2>TEE Book</h2>
	<p>I'm pleased announce the release of our book, <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-55561-9" target="_blank">Trusted Execution Environments</a>, published by Springer. We take a holistic view of TEEs, looking at operating system-level controls, containers and secure elements, those based on the Trusted Platform Module (TPM), and modern technologies such as Arm TrustZone, AMD SEV, and Intel SGX and TDX. Available from various retailers, including:</p>

	  <li>ðŸ“Œ <em>New:</em> I've joined the Editorial Board of <a href="https://www.nature.com/srep/" target="_blank">Scientific Reports (Nature)</a>.</li>
	  <li>ðŸ“Œ <em>New:</em> I'll be serving on the Programme Committee of <a href="https://sec2025.um.si/" target="_blank">IFIP SEC 2026</a>.</li>
	  <li>ðŸ“Œ <em>New:</em> New paper on control-flow attestation in Computers & Security. We present the first comprehensive look at using control-flow information for building trust in a target platform. You can read the paper <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167404824005601" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
	  <li>I have a new Python package on multi-set hashing, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pymsh/" target="_blank">pymsh</a>, which implements the schemes by <a href="https://www.iacr.org/cryptodb/data/paper.php?pubkey=151" target="_blank">Clarke et al. (Asiacrypt '03)</a>.</li>
          <li>I'll be serving on the Programme Committee of <a href="https://sec2025.um.si/" target="_blank">IFIP SEC 2025</a>.</li>
	  <li>I've been awarded Fellowship (FHEA) status from the <a href="https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Higher Education Academy</a> in recognition of high-quality teaching and support for student experience in higher education.</li>
	  <li>At Newcastle, I am a co-investigator of one of <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/information/academic-centres-excellence-cyber-security-research" target="_blank">NCSC's Academic Centres of Excellence in Cyber Security Research (ACE-CSR)</a>, a part of GCHQ, recognising internationally leading cyber security research.</li>
	  <li>Our project, <a href="https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/Y030168/1" target="_blank">Chameleon</a>, has been funded by EPSRC (~Â£1m). Here, we're tying CPU execution to environmental attributes, developing methods to prevent physical attacks that 'brick' the device when it's (physically) perturbed post-deployment.</li>
	  <li><a href="https://www.computer.org/csdl/journal/tq/5555/01/10278225/1R9IPHlsu2Y" target="_blank">Our work on new firmware-level side-channel attacks on Android devices has been published in IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing</a>. We show that methods for sensor measurement distribution to multiple applications can expose some quite nasty attacks which are difficult to rectify. Namely, we show how attackers can create covert channels that completely bypass the Android permissions system, as well as identifying types of sensor-enabled applications.</li>
	  <li><p><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9969153/" target="_blank">Our work on recognising black-box functions using hardware performance counters (HPCs) was accepted to IEEE Transactions on Computers</a>. We show that HPCs on mainstream processors can be used as a side-channel for vulnerability detection (using OpenSSL as a use case), interrogating trusted execution environments (using OP-TEE and ARM TrustZone), and general function fingerprinting with high accuracy. <a href="./papers/Shepherd_Investigating_Black-box_Function_Recognition_HPCs.pdf">The paper can be read here.</a></p><p>We comprehensively show that combining modalities, e.g. L1 cache hits, TLB misses, branch mis-predictions and more, is far more powerful than using individual ones explored up to this point. Personally, it's reasonable to expect that multi-modal micro-architectural attacks will be a source of major security problems; far more than, say, Spectre-style speculative execution or cache attacks alone.</p></li>
	  <li>In January 2023, I will leave Royal Holloway and join Newcastle University as a Lecturer in Computer Science.</li></ul>
