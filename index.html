	<p>I am a Lecturer (~Assistant Professor) in Computer Science at Newcastle University, United Kingdom, based within the <a href="https://www.ncl.ac.uk/computing/research/srs/">Secure and Resilient Systems group</a>. Prior to this, I was a Senior Research Fellow at the <a href="https://scc.rhul.ac.uk" target="_blank">Smart Card Centre (SCC)</a> within the <a href="https://isg.rhul.ac.uk" target="_blank">Information Security Group (ISG) at Royal Holloway, University of London</a>. 
 
	<p>My expertise lies in the areas of trusted execution environments (TEEs) and hardware-assisted security; side-channel and fault injection attacks; and smart cards, secure elements (e.g. SIM cards) and their applications. I'm also an active member of the Linux and RISC-V communities.

	  <p>If you are interested in pursuing a project, Ph.D. etc. on the above topics, then please reach out at <a href="mailto:carlton.shepherd@ncl.ac.uk">carlton.shepherd@ncl.ac.uk</a>.</p>
	
	<p>Before academia, I worked in fintech at <a href="https://atombank.co.uk" target="_blank">Atom Bank</a>, the UK's first mobile bank; and at <a href="https://onespan.com" target="_blank">OneSpan</a> as a research scientist.</p>
	
	<p>I hold a Ph.D. in Information Security from the <a href="https://isg.rhul.ac.uk" target="_blank">Information Security Group</a> at Royal Holloway, University of London, and a B.Sc. in Computer Science from Newcastle University.</p>

	<p>My technical publications can be found on my <a href="./publications.html">Publications</a> page or on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3V6gC5MAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao" target="_blank">Google Scholar</a>.</p>

	<h2>TEE Book</h2>
	<p>I'm pleased announce the release of our book, <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-55561-9" target="_blank">Trusted Execution Environments</a>, published by Springer. We take a holistic view of TEEs, looking at operating system-level controls, smart cards and secure elements, efforts based on the Trusted Platform Module (TPM), and modern technologies such as Arm TrustZone, AMD SEV, and Intel SGX and TDX. Available from various retailers, including:</p>

	  <li><p>Our project, <a href="https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/Y030168/1" target="_blank">Chameleon</a>, has been funded by EPSRC. Here, we're tying CPU execution to environmental attributes, developing methods to prevent physical attacks that 'brick' the device when it's (physically) perturbed post-deployment.</p></li>
	  <li><p>I've been provided hardware prototypes through the <a href="https://www.dsbd.tech/" target="_blank">UK Digital Security by Design (DSBD)</a> initiative and <a href="https://www.arm.com/architecture/cpu/morello" target="_blank">ARM Morello</a> programme to evaluate the <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/" target="_blank">CHERI</a> architecture. I'm happy to hear from prospective students who wish to join these efforts and work on some interesting CHERI projects.</p></li>
	  <li><p><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9969153/" target="_blank">Our work on recognising black-box functions using hardware performance counters (HPCs) was accepted to IEEE Transactions on Computers</a>, a top-tier journal in computer hardware. We show that HPCs on mainstream processors can be used as a side-channel for vulnerability detection (using OpenSSL as a use case), interrogating trusted execution environments (using OP-TEE and ARM TrustZone), and general function fingerprinting with high accuracy. <a href="./papers/Shepherd_Investigating_Black-box_Function_Recognition_HPCs.pdf">The paper can be viewed here.</a></p><p>We comprehensively show that combining modalities, e.g. L1 cache hits, TLB misses, branch mis-predictions and more, is far more powerful than using individual ones explored up to this point. Personally, it's reasonable to expect that multi-modal micro-architectural attacks will be a source of major security problems; far more than, say, Spectre-style speculative execution or cache attacks alone.</p></li>
	<li>In January 2023, I will leave Royal Holloway and join Newcastle University as a Lecturer in computer security, based at the Secure and Resilient Systems centre.</li></ul>
