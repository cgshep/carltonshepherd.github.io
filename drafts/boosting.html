		<p>In this two-part series, we&#8217;ll tour a family of machine learning algorithms known as <em>boosting</em>: what it is, how it works, its benefits, and its drawbacks. We&#8217;ll also look at some of the most widely-used algorithms, such as Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs), including&nbsp;XGBoost. </p>
<p>Boosting has been used successfully to place highly many Kaggle competitions, including the <a href="https://dbaumgartel.wordpress.com/2014/06/15/the-kaggle-higgs-challenge-beat-the-benchmarks-with-scikit-learn/">Higgs Boson</a>, <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/otto-group-product-classification-challenge/discussion/14335">product classification</a>, and <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection/discussion/111308#latest-645199"><span class="caps">IEEE</span>-<span class="caps">CIS</span> fraud detection</a> challenges. In general, it&#8217;s found great utility using structured tabular&nbsp;data.</p>
<p>In this first post, an overview of boosting is given, alongside some of its high-level benefits and drawbacks; some fundamental knowledge of machine learning is assumed, such as decision trees, hypotheses, variance, and&nbsp;bias.</p>
<h2>What is&nbsp;Boosting?</h2>
<p>Boosting is a family of meta-algorithms that use an <em>ensemble</em> of <em>weak learners</em> to produce a <em>strong learner</em>. Let&#8217;s break each of these terms&nbsp;down.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Meta-algorithm</em>. Boosting isn&#8217;t an algorithm, like a support vector machine (<span class="caps">SVM</span>), that generates and outputs a single model, or hypothesis function, over the training data. Instead, it&#8217;s a high-level process by which the outputs of a series of hypotheses from individual classifiers are used in an <em>ensemble</em> to produce a single classification output. Other widely used meta-algorithms include bootstrapping aggregation (<em>bagging</em>) methods, e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest">Random Forests</a>, and <em>stacking</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Ensemble</em>. Ensemble learning builds on a long-standing observation&#8212;-dating back to the late 1980s [1]&#8212;-that the aggregation of <em>multiple</em> hypotheses generally outperforms that of a single hypothesis. How the outputs are aggregated differs between algorithms: boosting uses the training set to generate multiple classifiers, where the final output is produced from a <em>weighted sum</em> of these sub-classifiers. <!-- Comparatively, *bagging* uses a number of random sub-samples from the training set, with replacement, upon which individual classifiers are trained; the final decision is produced using an unweighted majority vote of these classifers' results (for categorical outputs). Lastly, *stacking* uses an additional learning algorithm, such as logistic regression,--></p>
</li>
<li>A <em>weak learner</em> is a classifier that performs only marginally better than random, with high bias but low variance, while a <em>strong learner</em> is one with high predictive power with low bias and&nbsp;variance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Boosting </p>
<h2>AdaBoost</h2>
<p>Adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) was developed by Freund and Schapire [2], <a href="https://mailman.srv.cs.cmu.edu/pipermail/connectionists/2003-October/021353.html">who were subsequently awarded the G&#8221;odel Prize in 2003</a>. AdaBoost uses an iterative process in which each training sample is first assigned a weak learner; while any classifier can be used, a common practice is to use <em>decision stumps</em>. These are single-level decision trees of the form $$ f(\textbf{x}) = sign(x_k &gt; c)&nbsp;$$.</p>
