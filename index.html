	<p>I am a Lecturer (~Assistant Professor) in Computer Science at Newcastle University, United Kingdom. Beforehand, I was a Senior Research Fellow at the <a href="https://scc.rhul.ac.uk" target="_blank">Smart Card Centre (SCC)</a> within the <a href="https://isg.rhul.ac.uk" target="_blank">Information Security Group (ISG) at Royal Holloway, University of London</a>. Here, I was funded through the <a href="https://exfiles.eu" target="_blank">EU Horizon 2020 EXFILES</a> project, unifying European law enforcement agencies, the private sector, and academia to develop novel data extraction and mobile security circumvention techniques, including microarchitectural side-channels and fault injections against TEEs, full-disk encryption, secure boot, and more.</p>
 
	<p>My expertise lies in mobile and embedded systems security, particularly on issues at the interface of hardware and software. This includes trusted execution environments and other hardware-assisted methods for enforcing secure execution; side-channel and fault injection attacks; boot-time security; and smart cards, secure elements (e.g. SIM cards) and their applications. If anybody is interested in pursuing a project, PhD etc. on these topics with me, please reach out using the email address below.</p>

	<p>Before academia, I worked for a number of years in fintech: at <a href="https://atombank.co.uk" target="_blank">Atom Bank</a>, the UK's first mobile bank; and at <a href="https://onespan.com" target="_blank">OneSpan</a>, a NASDAQ-listed cybersecurity vendor, working as a research scientist developing new product offerings and enhancements.</p>
	
	<p>I hold a Ph.D. in Information Security from the <a href="https://isg.rhul.ac.uk" target="_blank">Information Security Group</a> at Royal Holloway, University of London, and a B.Sc. in Computer Science from Newcastle University.</p>

	<p>My technical publications can be found on my <a href="./publications.html">Publications</a> page or on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3V6gC5MAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao" target="_blank">Google Scholar</a>. Recent highlights include the discovery of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06363" target="_blank">design-level security vulnerabilities on all known sensor-enabled Android devices</a>.</p>
	<h2>News</h2>
	<ul>
	  <li><p>I've been provided hardware prototypes through the <a href="https://www.dsbd.tech/" target="_blank">UK Digital Security by Design (DSBD)</a> initiative and <a href="https://www.arm.com/architecture/cpu/morello" target="_blank">ARM Morello</a> programme to evaluate the <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/" target="_blank">CHERI</a> architecture. I'm happy to hear from prospective students who wish to join these efforts and work on some interesting CHERI projects.</p></li>
	  <li><p><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9969153/" target="_blank">Our work on recognising black-box functions using hardware performance counters (HPCs) was accepted to IEEE Transactions on Computers</a>, a top-tier journal in computer hardware. We show that HPCs on mainstream processors can be used as a side-channel for vulnerability detection (using OpenSSL as a use case), interrogating trusted execution environments (using OP-TEE and ARM TrustZone), and general function fingerprinting with high accuracy. <a href="./papers/Shepherd_Investigating_Black-box_Function_Recognition_HPCs.pdf">The paper can be viewed here.</a></p><p>We comprehensively show that combining modalities, e.g. L1 cache hits, TLB misses, branch mis-predictions and more, is far more powerful than using individual ones explored up to this point. Personally, it's reasonable to expect that multi-modal micro-architectural attacks will be a source of major security problems; far more than, say, Spectre-style speculative execution or cache attacks alone.</p></li>
	<li>In January 2023, I will leave Royal Holloway and join Newcastle University as a Lecturer in computer security, based at the Secure and Resilient Systems centre.</li></ul>

      <h2>Grants</h2>
      <ul>
	<li><strong>Principal investigator (PI):</strong> <em>Tensorcrypt: Democritising Encrypted Data Analytics</em>, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/innovate-uk" target="_blank">Innovate UK</a>, UKRI. Total: <strong>£73,740</strong> (Apr. '21 - Feb. '22. Phase 1: £13,951, Phase 2: £59,889).
	  <ul>
	    <li>This project developed a new, proof-of-concept privacy-preserving machine learning platform to allow organisations to jointly analyse data in sensitive domains (e.g. transaction fraud).  Performed code reviews and developed in line with best practices. It was conducted through Innovate UK's <a href="https://ktn-uk.org/programme/cyberasap/" target="_blank">CyberASAP</a> programme, which funds promising academic ideas for potential commercialisation through industrial/market engagement activities (Phase 1) and the development of a proof-of-concept (Phase 2). <a href="https://km.isg.rhul.ac.uk/">Prof. Konstantinos Markantonakis</a>, also of Royal Holloway, University of London, is CO-I.
