      <h1>Research</h1>
      <p>My research activity centres around the security of mobile devices and issues at the interfaces between hardware and software. More specifically, the latter includes the following low-level topics:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>Trusted execution environments (TEEs)</li>
	<li>CPU and firmware security</li>
	<li>Fault injection and side-channel attacks</li>
	<li>Security issues and applications of device sensors</li>
      </ul>

      Some highlights include the discovery of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06363" target="_blank">design-level security vulnerabilities on all known sensor-enabled Android devices</a>, developing mutually trusted channels for TEEs (see <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/software-guard-extensions/academic-research.html" target="_blank">Intel's Academic Research page </a>), and
